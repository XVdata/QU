##BASICS

Payments
           DESIDE BETWEEN
      Venmo
      PayPal
      https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications
  The Payment function needs to: 
    Accept Money
    Create and Show a Balance
  BRIDGE:
    Music API:
      Purchase froms store cart
    CDJ Analasys:
      accept full payment after the track 
      is analysed as already played
            

Music 

          DECIDE BETWEEN
    Beatport - this would be best due to royalty payments on tracks
    Itunes
  Search:
    the music section needs to search for tracks from user input
    add track to the cart
    
    give a base amount for the track
    
    send the purchased track through to the analysis api
    
    download the track to the hard drive
  BRIDGE:
    Payment API:
      Accept payment  
    Analasys API:
      send to analasys 


Analasys:
  Accept downloaded tracks from music api
  analyse tracks for:
    BPM
    Key
  Return:
    When tracks are played
    send return information to payment 
    
  BRIDGE:
    Music API:
      needs to recieve tracks
    Payments:
      needs to return played information in /
      to accept full payment 











PLAN

This project will heavily use the Class functions 
    The Music API catagorize all of the tracks as objects 
    
    The best way to tackle the transfer of information will
    be to simply use the objects provided 
    these objects provide:
      Key
      BPM
      number of plays
      (for more details use)
      https://api.beatport.com/v4/docs/my/downloads/
Using Beatport API we should be able to give more than enough information 
to the analasys side of the project.

We will create a queue system for all of the tracks added each object will have:
  Payment amount (user input)
  the track name
  the artist name
  the track key in both standard and camelot system
  the bpm
  the genre
  whether or not the track as been played (boolian expression)

There is no specific Rekordbox API so a work around will need to be created. 
we will need to export the files in the same standard that rekordbox would export. 
since the use base is a usb to usb interface that would allow access them in a whole new light
though making it more difficult it actuall should cut out some time in the process
We will need to figure out how EXACTLY the tracks are analyzed by the system and make 
changes accordingly..... Luckily with the access to cdjs we should be able to test it out on a 
consistent enough basis that we should be able to hammer down a good and consistent use 

TECH SPECS 
For the initial development we will use a raspberypi 
we can add a touchscreen to the system in order to allow 
the perfect amount of user interfacing and comfort 
ALONG WITH 
along with all of the work so far the pi will need to be loaded to reload itself while the device isnt in use 
in order to allow the CDJs to recognize that more information has been added to it the best option for this is:
    a notification system that would prompt the user to acknowledge the new requests
    a prompt asking if they would like to restart the program
    (this way the device wont restart in the middle of a currently playing track)

Making sure that the djs ability to play music wont be infringed is the absolute most important portion of this project

### we could implement a system for a copy usb of the djs current playlist that would allow
    QU to check the DJ's files for tracks saving the customer money 
    (they wouldnt need to pay the royalty simply tip the dj)




NOTES:
This device is for the use as a suplement to djs not a replacement for 
a normal setlist
